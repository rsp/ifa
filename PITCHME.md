iFM Promotional Stunt

---

But first, since we are on the topic of promotion...

---

This is how we see ourselves on GitHub:

![](gh-sum-l-a.png)

---

This is how other people see us on GitHub:

![](gh-sum-i-a.png)

---

Who are those brave 4 who<br>don't hide that they belong
to inFullMobile?

---

![](gh-b4.png)

---

It's even worse on Stack Overflow.

Only 3 people have ever admitted working at inFullMobile.

---

---

Recently we were discussing the topic of company
promotion on GitHub and Stack Overflow.

<small>
(Not hiding the fact that we work here would be a good start.)
</small>

---

We should take an example from the design team<br>
who have excellent presence on Dribbble and Behance:

- https://dribbble.com/infullmobile
- https://www.behance.net/inFullMobile

---

This is in striking contrast to:

<small>
- https://github.com/inFullMobile (see in incognito)
- https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/lists/160162/infullmobile?storyType=1
</small>

Now back to the hackathon.

Hackathon theme: iFM Promotional Stunt

A good promotional stunt would be to:

1. Have a *fast* website and blog about its speed
2. Use *modern* technologies and blog about it
3. Make new designs frequently and let people vote
4. Make a periodical contest for a better website

---

Problem #1:

infullmobile.com website is sloooooow.

(*Especially* when accessed from the US.
Wouldn't be a problem if we didn't look for clients there,
but we do.)

---

Problem #2:

It's hard to optimize because we're using ready-made software
not targetted for developers.

---

Problem #3:

To try new designs we can only create WordPress themes.

In PHP.

---

Problem #4:

It's hard to use any modern frontend technology
like Vue, Aurelia Stencil or Svelte.

---

Problem #5:

Using any backend technology other than PHP is out of the question.

---

Problem #6:

It's hard to tell people that we use modern technology
when our own website is powered by PHP ("Personal Home Page")
that is not particularly well known for high quality

Some numbers

---

**5+ seconds** (not milliseconds!)<br>load time on WebPageTest

- First Byte Time: F grade
- Cache static content: F grade
- Effective use of CDN: No

---

**3/100**<br>score on testmysite.io

- Slow TTFB (Time To First Byte)
- Slow loading HTML
- HTTP2 not enabled

---

What can we do:

- Use modern technologies
- Expose all data with an API
- Build a Static/JAMstack website
- Use good hosting with CDN

---

What is **JAM**stack

- client-side __J__avaScript
- reusable __A__PIs
- prebuilt __M__arkup

---

Advantages:

- We'll be up-to-date with modern technologies
- Clients will see that we can build fast systems
- Easy to build new website prototypes
- Easy to create a company mobile app

---

We'll have good recruitment tasks:

  - create a website using the API
  - create a mobile app using the API
  - create a Progressive Web App
  - create a backend integration with the API

---

We'll be able to say that even our website is built
with the best technology we could find.

---

I started with creating a simple API
exposing some of the content used on the website

- API: https://ifapi.herokuapp.com/
- Website: https://ifapi.netlify.com/

The API is powered by a Mongo database.

The website gets the data from the API
using delays to show what's happening.

---

Demo time

---

It would not be convenient for non-developers so
I started exploring tools to make the process
of content authoring easier and more convenient.

Using a headless CMS seems like the way to go.

---

What can we do:

1. Put content into a headless CMS
2. Create a static website
3. Connect website to the CMS via API

Now all content changes via GUI will be visible on the website.

---

What's a headless CMS?

Something like WordPress admin panel but without the website.

It decouples the content authoring process from the
frontend implementation.

---

Headless CMS works like this:

- a convenient UI is used to easily edit content
- all the data is exposed via API to the frontend

---

We can switch the frontend:

  - without changing the authoring process
  - without exporting/importing existing content

---

The frontend can be:

- a custom website in vanilla JS
- a single-page application (SPA)
- a progressive web app (PWA)
- it can be rendered client-side or server-side
- using Angular, React, Vue, Ember, Aurelia...
- using Disappearing Frameworks like Svelte, Stencil... 
- using a static site generator

---

Tech stack

Headless CMS - hosted:

- Netlify CMS - https://www.netlifycms.org/

---

**Contentful** is used in one of our commercial projects.

Client is familiar with that and it was a requirement but none of us had any prior experience.

It would be safer to learn those tools on internal projects.
