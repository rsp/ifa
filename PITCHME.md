What can we do:

- Use modern technologies
- Expose all data with an API
- Build a Static/JAMstack website
- Use good hosting with CDN

---

Bonus:

- We'll have good recruitment tasks:
  - Backend: create an API using a database
  - Frontend: create a website using the API
  - Mobile: create an app using the API
- We'll be able to create a company mobile app

---

JAMstack

(client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup)
