# inFullApi

Hackathon

---

But first...

---

This is how we see ourselves on GitHub:

---

This is how other people see us on GitHub:

---

Who are those brave 4 who<br>don't hide that they work here?

Any guesses?

---

---

It's even worse on Stack Overflow.

Only 3 people have ever admitted working at inFullMobile.

---

---

Now back to the hackathon.

---

Problem:

infullmobile.com website is sloooooow.

Especially when accessed from the US.

Not a problem if we don't look for clients there.

Unfortunately we do.

What can we do:

- Use modern technologies
- Expose all data with an API
- Build a Static/JAMstack website
- Use good hosting with CDN

---

Advantages:

- We'll be up-to-date with modern technologies
- Clients will see that we can build fast systems
- We'll be able to create a company mobile app easily
- We'll be able to build and test new website prototypes

---

We'll have good recruitment tasks:

  - Backend: create an API using the database
  - Frontend: create a website using the API
  - Mobile: create an app using the API

---

**JAM**stack

- client-side __J__avaScript
- reusable __A__PIs
- prebuilt __M__arkup

---

How can we incrementally achieve the goal:

1. Use a headless CMS
2. Import data from WordPress
3. Create a static website based on the current HTML
4. Populate it with the data from the new CMS via API
5. Incrementally improve the website or create new versions

---

What's a headless CMS?

Something like WordPress admin panel but without the website.

It decouples the content authoring process from the
frontend implementation.

---

It works like this:

- the headless CMS is used to easily edit content
with a convenient UI
- it exposes all the data via API to the frontend
- we can switch the frontend without:
  - changing the authoring process
  - exporting/importing existing content

---

The frontend can be:

- a custom website in vanilla JS
- a single-page application (SPA)
- it can be rendered client-side or server-side
- it can use Angular, React, Vue, Ember, Aurelia...
- it can use a static site generator

I didn't find anything better yet.

We already use it.

---

Why this presentation is called inFullAPI?

Because I started with creating a simple API
exposing some of the content used on the website.

The idea was to have all the data in a custom database.

---

It would not be convenient for non-developers so
I started exploring tools to make the process
of content authoring easier and more convenient.

Using a headless CMS seems like the way to go.
